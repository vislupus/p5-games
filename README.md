# Games with p5.js

## About

This repository showcases a diverse range of captivating games, all built using the powerful [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.

The inspiration for many of these games comes from the brilliant work of [Daniel Shiffman](http://twitter.com/shiffman) and his incredible YouTube channel, [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw). Through his tutorials and creative coding projects, Daniel has inspired countless developers and artists to explore the exciting world of coding.

I used materials from the Udemy's course [How to Program Games: Tile Classics in JS for HTML5 Canvas](https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-program-games/) taught by [Chris DeLeon](https://hometeamgamedev.com/).

The [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gww_4GBZnjc) that I followed for the Tetris game.
